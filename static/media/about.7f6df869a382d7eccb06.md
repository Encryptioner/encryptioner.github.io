Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a _Lead Full-Stack Software Engineer_ at [NerdDevs](https://nerddevs.com/) based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

I'm an enthusiastic _Solution Architect_ with a passion for solving challenging problems and taking things one step ahead. I'm well acquainted with various *web & mobile software development tech* & *research methods* as well as *frontend*, *backend*, *database*, *testing* and *cloud technologies*. I have always been a firm believer in solving problems with passion and care for long-term support. Therefore, I strive to follow best software development approach for developers & all stakeholders. 

For software development, I primarily code in **Typescript** & **Python**. For the backend and frontend, I mostly use **NodeJs**, **VueJs**, **MongoDB,** and other tools related to this ecosystem. For mobile apps I prefer **Flutter**. I try to automate the developments with **CI/CD** and am fluent with the **AWS ecosystem**. I believe in continuous learning. I learn through multiple blogs, weekly newsletters, and social and tech platforms.

It's in my nature to lead my team for betterment. I thrive to learn from people and challenges. I enjoy helping people and sharing my knowledge. With different responsibilities, my scope for **competitive programming** has reduced. But it is my first love and occasionally solve problems on different platforms.

In my free time, I love to travel 🌏, play cricket 🏏, read books 📖, watch movies 🎥, listen to songs 🎵, explore neighborhoods through food, and occasionally bring out my inner photographer 📸. Also, did someone say hiking? 🏔️
